# Cryptocurrencies

Dogecoin and Litecoin using Scrypt algorithm rather than SHA-256.
3 types
  1. Individual mining,
  2. Dogecoin mining pools,
  3. Cloud mining.

## How does dogecoin mining work?
Dogecoin’s blockchain network employs the same system for adding new blocks to its decentralized ledger and reaching agreement among its network participants as bitcoin, litecoin and many other cryptocurrencies.

Known as a “Proof-of-Work” (PoW) mechanism, this process involves “mining” where individuals or organizations compete for the right to add new blocks containing pending transactions to the blockchain ledger using specialized computer equipment.

More specifically, miners use their machines to try and create a fixed length code known as a “hash” with a value that is equal to or lower than the target value of the new block, known as the “target hash.” Whoever creates the winning code earns the exclusive right to add new transaction data to the next block in the chain and is rewarded with newly minted coins for doing so.

Each hash generated is completely random so it’s simply a process of trial and error until one miner wins.

Here is how dogecoin mining compares to bitcoin and litecoin mining (as of January 2022):

| type | Dogecoin      | Litecoin      | Bitcoin      |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Algorithm |	Scrypt | Scrypt | SHA-256
| Block time | 1 min | 2.5 min | 10 min
| Difficulty | 5.05 million | 11.89 million | 24.37 trillion
| Reward per block | 10,000 | 12.5 | 6.25
| Total supply | Infinite | 84,000,000 | 21,000,000

As a rule, PoW blockchains such as bitcoin and litecoin usually have a predetermined total supply of coins that have to be mined in order for them to be added to the circulating supply (21 million and 84 million, respectively). Think of it as being like actual mining and how precious gems or gold have to be physically mined before they can enter the market.

Unlike a vast majority of cryptocurrencies, however, dogecoin doesn’t have a maximum supply cap. Its circulating supply will continue to increase indefinitely over time as new coins are created through mining.

New blocks are discovered approximately once every minute on the Dogecoin network. For comparison, Bitcoin blocks are discovered approximately once every 10 minutes.

Despite using the same Proof-of-Work system, dogecoin mining operates slightly differently than bitcoin.

Bitcoin, which is the oldest and largest cryptocurrency by market cap, uses a hashing algorithm called SHA-256. This might sound complicated but a hashing algorithm is simply a function that generates a fixed-length code using a certain technique. Think of it as random code generators, where each hashing algorithm creates random codes in a unique way.

Dogecoin and litecoin use a hashing algorithm called Scrypt, which is less complex than SHA-256. This makes mining litecoin and dogecoin much faster and less energy intensive than bitcoin.

The use of a common algorithm enabled Dogecoin and Litecoin mining to be “merged mined”, meaning both coins can be mined simultaneously without impacting operational efficiency. The two share a common algorithm because dogecoin’s design is based on luckycoin, which in turn was derived from litecoin.

## How to mine dogecoin
In its early years, mining dogecoin was much easier because very few people participated in the network. This meant anyone could mine the coin individually. However, as the popularity of DOGE increased, the mining process became more difficult, prompting miners to come together and form “mining pools.”

A mining pool is a group of individual miners who mine the cryptocurrency as a single entity, or node, by merging their computing power. The rewards are then distributed among pool participants proportionally by the amount of computer power committed by each miner.

Today, there are three main approaches to mining dogecoin:
  1. Individual mining/solo mining
  2. Dogecoin mining pools
  3. Cloud mining

## Solo mining vs. dogecoin mining pools

For anyone looking to mine DOGE for fun or simply to understand the process, it can be done independently using a GPU (graphics processing unit) through a software like EasyMiner, for example. The GPU is a specialized processor that renders all images on a computer's screen, and many laptops and desktop computers use it to improve image processing.

However, mining alone can be a difficult process and is rarely profitable unless one is willing to shell out significant sums of money on top-spec equipment and electrical bills.

For crypto enthusiasts interested in trying to make a profit from doge mining, joining a dogecoin mining pool is recommended and provides a much better chance of 
becoming a block validator due to the collective hashing power of the pool. But before jumping into a mining pool, be ready to pay 1%-3% in fees for the privilege 
to participate and always check in advance how each pool calculates payouts for its members.

## Dogecoin cloud mining

Dogecoin can also be earned through cloud mining, which is not really mining per se. Cloud mining basically involves renting computing power from a data center and 
paying a monthly or annual fee based on an agreed-upon contract. The chosen coin is then mined at the center via a mining pool and then shared with you based on 
how much computing power you pay for.

The main drawback of cloud mining is that most contracts are time-locked, meaning you can lose money if DOGE prices drop below the operational and electrical costs 
associated with mining it.

Nevertheless, this can also be just as effective as joining a mining pool and does not require the user to own any specialist equipment. Anyone opting for the 
cloud mining route simply needs a dogecoin wallet.
