            <h2 class="post-title">Edgar Allan Poe</h2>
            <h3 class="post-subtitle">A Tell-Tale Heart, 1843</h3>
            <h3 class="post-subtitle" style="font-size:80%">TRUE! -- nervous -- very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why<br> 
              will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses -- not<br>
              destroyed -- not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I<br>
              heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell.<br> 
              How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily -- how calmly I can<br>
              tell you the whole story.<br>
              <br>
              It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once <br>
              conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there <br>
              was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given <br>
              me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it was this!<br>
              He had the eye of a vulture --a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it <br>
              fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees -- very gradually --I made <br>
              up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye <br>
              forever.<br>
              <br>
              Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you <br>
              should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded --with <br>
              what caution --with what foresight --with what dissimulation I went to work!<br>
              I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed<br>
              him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and <br>
              opened it --oh so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for<br> 
              my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, so that no light shone out,<br> 
              and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how <br>
              cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly --very, very slowly, so that I might <br>
              not disturb the old man's sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head <br>
              within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! --<br>
              would a madman have been so wise as this? And then, when my head was <br>
              well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously --oh, so cautiously --cautiously <br>
              (for the hinges creaked) --I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell <br>
              upon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights --every night just at <br>
              midnight --but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do <br>
              the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And <br>
              every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke <br>
              courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how <br>
              he has passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound old <br>
              man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him <br>
              while he slept.<br>
              <br>
              Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the <br>
              door. watch's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before <br>
              that night had I felt the extent of my own powers --of my sagacity. I could <br>
              scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the <br>
              door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. <br>
              I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the <br>
              bed suddenly, as if startled. Now you may think that I drew back --but no. His <br>
              room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness, (for the shutters were <br>
              close fastened, through fear of robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see <br>
              the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.<br>
              <br>
              I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb <br>
              slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in bed, crying out -<br>
              -"Who's there?"<br>
              <br>
              I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a <br>
              muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still sitting <br>
              up in the bed listening; --just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to <br>
              the death watches in the wall.<br>
              <br>
              Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal <br>
              terror. It was not a groan of pain or of grief --oh, no! --it was the low stifled <br>
              sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. I <br>
              knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, <br>
              it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the <br>
              terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, <br>
              and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying <br>
              awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His <br>
              fears had been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy <br>
              them causeless, but could not. He had been saying to himself --"It is nothing <br>
              but the wind in the chimney --it is only a mouse crossing the floor," or "It is <br>
              merely a cricket which has made a single chirp." Yes, he had been trying to <br>
              comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain. All in <br>
              vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow <br>
              before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of <br>
              the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel --although he neither saw <br>
              nor heard --to feel the presence of my head within the room.<br>
              <br>
              When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie <br>
              down, I resolved to open a little --a very, very little crevice in the lantern. So I <br>
              opened it --you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily --until, at length a <br>
              single dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell <br>
              full upon the vulture eye.<br>
              <br>
              It was open --wide, wide open --and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw <br>
              it with perfect distinctness --all a dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that <br>
              chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old <br>
              man's face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon <br>
              the damned spot.<br>
              <br>
              And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over <br>
              acuteness of the senses? --now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick <br>
              sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that sound <br>
              well, too. It was the beating of the old man's heart. It increased my fury, as the <br>
              beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.<br>
              <br>
              But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern <br>
              motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eye. <br>
              Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and <br>
              quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The old man's terror must have<br> 
              been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment! --do you mark me <br>
              well? I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of <br>
              the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as <br>
              this excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I <br>
              refrained and stood still. But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the <br>
              heart must burst. And now a new anxiety seized me --the sound would be <br>
              heard by a neighbor! The old man's hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw <br>
              open the lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once --once only. In <br>
              an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I <br>
              then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the <br>
              heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would <br>
              not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was dead. I <br>
              removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I <br>
              placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no <br>
              pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye would trouble me no more.<br>
              <br>
              If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the <br>
              wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. The night waned, <br>
              and I worked hastily, but in silence. First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut <br>
              off the head and the arms and the legs.<br>
              <br>
              I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited <br>
              all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so <br>
              cunningly, that no human eye -- not even his --could have detected any thing <br>
              wrong. There was nothing to wash out --no stain of any kind --no blood-spot <br>
              whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had caught all --ha! ha!<br>
              <br>
              When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o'clock --still dark as <br>
              midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street <br>
              door. I went down to open it with a light heart, --for what had I now to fear? <br>
              There entered three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as <br>
              officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbor during the night; <br>
              suspicion of foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the <br>
              police office, and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the premises.<br>
              <br>
              I smiled, --for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The <br>
              shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was absent <br>
              in the country. I took my visitors all over the house. I bade them search --<br>
              search well. I led them, at length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, <br>
              secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into <br>
              the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in <br>
              the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very <br>
              spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim.<br>
              <br>
              The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was singularly <br>
              at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar <br>
              things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone. My <br>
              head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still they sat and still <br>
              chatted. The ringing became more distinct: --it continued and became more <br>
              distinct: I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and <br> 
              gained definiteness --until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my <br>
              ears.<br>
              <br>
              No doubt I now grew very pale; --but I talked more fluently, and with a <br>
              heightened voice. Yet the sound increased --and what could I do? It was a low, <br>
              dull, quick sound --much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in <br>
              cotton. I gasped for breath -- and yet the officers heard it not. I talked more <br>
              quickly --more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased. I arose and <br>
              argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the <br>
              noise steadily increased. Why would they not be gone? I paced the floor to <br>
              and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observations of the men <br>
              -- but the noise steadily increased. Oh God! what could I do? I foamed --I <br>
              raved --I swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it <br>
              upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. It <br>
              grew louder --louder --louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and <br>
              smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God! --no, no! They heard! --<br>
              they suspected! --they knew! --they were making a mockery of my horror! --<br>
              this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better than this agony! <br>
              Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those <br>
              hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die! --and now --<br>
              again! --hark! louder! louder! louder! louder! --<br>
              <br>
              "Villains!" I shrieked, "dissemble no more! I admit the deed! --tear up the <br>
              planks! --here, here! --it is the beating of his hideous heart!"<br>
              <br>
              "Villains!" I shrieked, "dissemble no more! I admit the deed! --tear up the planks! <br>
              --here, here! --it is the beating of his hideous heart!"</h3>

            <h2 class="post-title">"Two possibilities exist: Either we are alone in the Universe or we are not.
              Both are equally terrifying." -- Arthur C. Clarke</h2>
            <h3 class="post-subtitle">In 1961, scientists gathered to discuss Extra-Terrestrials and data gathered
              up until then.  They came to the conclusion there were between 2 and 3 MILLion species of aliens in
              the Milky Way Galaxy ALONE!  Not to mention the other trillion galaxies in the known universe.  No
              wonder the World is being visited daily.
